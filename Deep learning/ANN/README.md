We trained ANN model to predict the customer  will  stay or leave the bank based on the dataset & who leave the bank.

Here we are solving the bank problem.here'1' means customer is already leave the bank, and '0' means in data set customer still using this bank. So bank wants to know what are the chances that customer will leave or stay in the bank.
